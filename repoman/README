This is the beginning of the repository manager.

For now, this is using python sockets, but that's just until we can get REST working.   

This is pretty much in an unusable state right now (no install, have to manually create the database, etc.) but it's going to get cleaned up real soon.

If you have questions, e-mail fransham@uvic.ca
